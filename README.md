# advent_of_code2022
These are my solutions to most of the days for 2022's Advent of Code. I used this challenge to sharpen my skills of C++ and its many data structures while also trying to finish each problem within a day.

Through these challenges, I learned about search algorithms like breadth first search, depth first search, and Dijkstra's algorithm. I also learned how to optimize my code since many of the solutions, although easy, take hours to run without optimization.
